Metrocar Project: Performance Analysis Overview

This project applies data analytics to optimize the Metrocar platform by identifying user drop-offs, improving conversions, and refining revenue strategies. Using data extraction from a PostgreSQL database and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly, the project highlights key insights into user behavior and platform performance.

Methodology:

	•	Data Extraction: Retrieved key datasets (app downloads, ride requests, demographics) via SQLAlchemy.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaned and visualized data to uncover trends and drop-off points.
	•	Funnel Analysis: Identified significant drop-offs during signup, ride requests, and ride completion stages.
	•	Demographic Insights: Analyzed user age groups to target high-engagement segments.
	•	Surge Pricing Analysis: Recommended dynamic pricing strategies based on peak demand.

Key Findings:

	•	Drop-Off Issues: Focus on reducing cancellations and improving driver availability.
	•	Platform Insights: iOS dominates (60.5%), with opportunities for Android and web optimization.
	•	Target Demographics: Focus on users aged 35-44, with younger tech-savvy users (18-24) showing growth potential.

Recommendations:

	•	Simplify user flows and improve payment systems.
	•	Prioritize iOS marketing and optimize Android/web platforms.
	•	Implement surge pricing and adjust dynamically.
	•	Increase driver availability and professionalism to improve user satisfaction.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance user retention, drive conversions, and fuel growth on the Metrocar platform.
