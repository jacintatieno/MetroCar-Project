Metrocar Project: Performance Analysis Overview

This project analyzes Metrocar’s key performance metrics to improve user retention, engagement, and revenue. Key findings include:
	•	Critical Drop-Off Points: Ride completion (49.8%) is the weakest stage. Solutions include simplifying signups, improving payment setups, and enhancing driver availability.
	•	Platform Insights: iOS leads with 60.5% of users, while Android (29.4%) and Web (10.1%) present growth opportunities.
	•	Target Audience: Focus on the 35-44 and 25-34 age groups, while reducing data gaps (30.1% unknown age data).
	•	Demand and Surge Pricing: Peak demand at 8 AM is ideal for surge pricing tests.

Recommendations: Streamline user flows, optimize platform performance, target high-priority demographics, and improve the ride experience to increase conversions and satisfaction.
